Hux

# About

Hux is a project specifically designed for developers, allowing hook
implementations without needing to define a .module file or any kind of proxy
class/service features.

There are a [few][project-hook_event_dispatcher] [projects][project-hooks]
[out][project-entity_events] there that try to introduce an event subscriber
driven way of working.
Hux is an in between solution, allowing the full benefits of dependency
injection and class driven logic without going fully in with events.
Methods can have the same signature as original hook implementations.
Discovery is automatic, only requiring a hook class to be registered as a
tagged Drupal service and initial cache clear.

Other features

 - Multiple hook implementations per module!
 - Overriding original hook implementations is possible using the
   `[#ReplaceOriginalHook]` annotation.
 - Supports alters.

# Installation

 1. Install as normally.
 2. No additional steps if running Drupal 9.4 or later. If using Drupal 9.3, use
    a patch core from https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2616814

# Usage

Add an entry to your modules' services.yml file. The entry simply needs to be a
public service, with a class and the 'hooks' tag.

Once a hook class has been added as a service, just clear the site cache.

Tip: You do not need to clear the site cache to add more hook implementations!

```yaml
services:
  my_module.hooks:
    class: Drupal\my_module\MyModuleHooks
    tags:
      - { name: hooks }
```

And in the class file:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Drupal\my_module;

use Drupal\hux\Attribute\Alter;
use Drupal\hux\Attribute\Hook;
use Drupal\hux\Attribute\OriginalInvoker;
use Drupal\hux\Attribute\ReplaceOriginalHook;

/**
 * Usage examples.
 */
final class MyModuleHooks {

  #[Hook('entity_access')]
  public function myEntityAccess(EntityInterface $entity, string $operation, AccountInterface $account): AccessResultInterface {
    // A barebones implementation.
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

  #[Hook('entity_access', priority: 100)]
  public function myEntityAccess2(EntityInterface $entity, string $operation, AccountInterface $account): AccessResultInterface {
    // You can set priority if you have multiple of the same hook!
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

  #[Hook('entity_access', moduleName: 'a_different_module', priority: 200)]
  public function myEntityAccess3(EntityInterface $entity, string $operation, AccountInterface $account): AccessResultInterface {
    // You can masquerade as a different module!
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

  #[ReplaceOriginalHook(hook: 'entity_access', moduleName: 'media')]
  public function myEntityAccess4(EntityInterface $entity, string $operation, AccountInterface $account): AccessResultInterface {
    // You can override hooks for other modules! E.g \media_entity_access()
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

  #[ReplaceOriginalHook(hook: 'entity_access', moduleName: 'media')]
  public function myEntityAccess5(EntityInterface $entity, string $operation, AccountInterface $account, #[OriginalInvoker] callable $originalInvoker): AccessResultInterface {
    // If you override a hook for another module, you can have the original
    // implementation passed to you as a callable!
    $originalResult = $originalInvoker($entity, $operation, $account);
    // Do something...
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

  #[Alter('user_format_name')]
  public function myCustomAlter(string &$name, AccountInterface $account): void {
    $name .= ' altered!';
  }

  #[
    Hook('entity_insert'),
    Hook('entity_delete'),
  ]
  public function myEntityAccess(EntityInterface $entity): void {
    // Associate with multiple!
    // Also works with Alters and Replacements.
    return AccessResult::neutral();
  }

}
```

The project makes use of PHP annotations. As of this writing Drupal's code
sniffs don't work that great with PHP 8.0/8.1 features, you can use the patch
at https://www.drupal.org/project/coder/issues/3250346 to appease code sniffer.

Working examples of all Hux features can be found in included tests.

# Optional configuration

## Optimised mode

Hux' [optimized mode][optimized-mode] provides an option geared towards being
developer friendly or optimized for production use. By default this mode is off,
but it should be turned on in production for small gains in performance.

To control whether Hux optimized mode is on or off, add to your `services.yml`:

```yaml
parameters:
  hux:
    optimize: true
```
